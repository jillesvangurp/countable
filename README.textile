h1. Merged into XMLTools

I no longer maintain this. I originally needed this for my xmltools project, which now has similar functionality included. So, go look there.

h1. Introduction

This is a little framework for counting stuff and keeping track of average duration. Useful for keeping track of metrics for things like making web service calls, etc.

h1. Installation

It's a maven project. So, checking it out and doing a mvn clean install should do the trick. If there is demand for it, I may eventually deploy a stable jar somewhere. If you really need this, please contact me.

However, since it is only a few classes, I recommend you simply copy it into your project and adapt it to your needs. The license allows you to do this and I have no problems with this.

Should anyone like this licensed differently, please contact me.
